Millions of people share their thoughts daily on social media regarding brands, products, trends, celebrities and politics
This is a huge reserve of untapped data, that could be used to understand trends and gain valuable insights
Furthermore, search trends and social conversations live in silos. Combining these could lead to connecting popular trends with consumer sentiment
The lifecycle of trends is getting shorter and shorter. Therefore traditional methods companies are using to monitor trends can often mean trends have peaked or shifted before actions can be taken

Target Users include,
brand marketing teams - understand consumer sentiment on brands and their products, get alerted of viral trends they can capitalize on for marketing purposes.
product managers - see what products are trending in their industry and what they could add
creators and influencers - they need to know what their audience likes, how their audience and the public feels about them, and they need to know when a trend is starting, so that they can use that to inform future posts.
